# **Satellite Imagery and Depth Data Analysis for Climate-Resilient and Eco-Friendly Urban Development**

This repository provides resources, code, and workflows for analyzing **urban development** and detecting **deformations** using satellite imagery and depth data. The project utilizes datasets such as **OpenStreetMap**, **Maxar WorldView**, and **Sentinel-2** to monitor urban changes and assess environmental impacts.

## **Overview**

The project focuses on:

- Monitoring urban changes over time using satellite imagery.
- Detecting and analyzing deformations in urban areas.
- Supporting climate-resilient and eco-friendly urban development through spatial analysis.
