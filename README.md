# **Satellite Imagery and Depth Data Analysis for Climate-Resilient and Eco-Friendly Urban Development**

Satellite imagery with depth inspires in-depth attention; hence, ecological assessments and eco-friendly urbanizations include it in very critical assessment and planning because of high-definition insights from it into the environmental nature of any ecosystem-a concrete base for proper development. This present research, therefore, investigates feature analysis in regard to building height, vegetation cover, and landscape using urban environments based on data emanating from a satellite-derived depths of features study area. We apply advanced geospatial analysis to identify the most eligible places for green infrastructures, renewable energy installations, and adaptive water management. This set of guidelines is intended for use by urban planners in an effort to realize a climate-resilient, resource-efficient city while reducing as much as possible the ecological footprint of urban areas and improving at the same time the quality of living within cities. This will, therefore, enable decision-makers to make evidence-based decisions in view of sustainable urban design through the use of satellite data in the balancing act between growth and the conservation of the environment.
